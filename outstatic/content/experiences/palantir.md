I really enjoyed my time at Palantir! I working across the entire stack, responsible for ensuring the backend and frontend all had the necessary changes to bring my features to life. I was placed within a great team, and was working on the interesting AIP (Palantir's AI offering) related work within the company. Here are a few notable achievements from my time there:\
\
• Led AIP Assist development by creating specialized plugins and selection logic to leveraging proprietary LLMs, supporting multi-step queries, and growing usage by 62% .\
• Developed an internal tool to answer developer queries by performing semantic search by leveraging sharded codebase, and passing results as context while optimizing for token limits.\
• Devised migration strategies to further decompose user permissions into smaller operations, allowing support for granular access control and view-only modes.\
• Optimized Java services with caching, proxy objects, and multi-threading, reducing the p99 latency for orchestration endpoints by over 41%.\
• Engineered performant, lightweight, and modular pages using Typescript and React, leveraging dynamic imports to reduce initial load times by 14% and enhance user state rendering.

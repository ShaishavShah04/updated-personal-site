## Hey, I'm Shaishav! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent Computing Science / Business graduate from University of Alberta. I love solving complex problems with real-world impact, bridging the tech gap between industries. Having worked in both big tech and fast startups, I've grown into an opiniated developer who isn't afraid to take charge and lead projects. Alongside development, I also *love* data science and analyzing data to draw insights. Outside of development, you can catch me painting, teaching, or swimming!

**Niricson Software Inc** - Victoria, Canada - 2022

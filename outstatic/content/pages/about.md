## Hey, I'm Shaishav! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent &lt;u&gt;Computing Science / Business&lt;/u&gt; graduate from University of Alberta. I love solving complex problems with real-world impact, bridging the tech gap between industries. Having worked in both big tech and fast startups, I've grown into an opiniated developer who isn't afraid to take charge and lead projects. Alongside development, I also *love* data science and analyzing data to draw insights. Outside of development, you can catch me painting, teaching, or swimming!

### Some of my past experiences! 

- **Palantir** - End-to-end integration of AIP (Palantir's leading AI Platform) into our team's platform
- **Niricson Software Inc** -  Developing a dashboard to visualize 500,000+ vectorized geospatial geometries without performance issues, implementing an ad-hoc analysis tools based on geospatial data, and talking with clients directly to understand needs!

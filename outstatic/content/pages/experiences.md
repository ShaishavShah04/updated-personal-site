Here's a bit about my past experience and education...

# Experience

### Palantir | Software Engineer Intern | 2023

I really enjoyed my time at Palantir! I working across the entire stack, responsible for ensuring the backend and frontend all had the necessary changes to bring my features to life. I was placed within a great team, and was working on the interesting AIP (Palantir's AI offering) related work within the company. Here are a few notable achievements from my time there:\
\
• Led AIP Assist development by creating specialized plugins and selection logic to leveraging proprietary LLMs, supporting multi-step queries, and growing usage by 62% .\
• Developed an internal tool to answer developer queries by performing semantic search by leveraging sharded codebase, and passing results as context while optimizing for token limits.\
• Devised migration strategies to further decompose user permissions into smaller operations, allowing support for granular access control and view-only modes.\
• Optimized Java services with caching, proxy objects, and multi-threading, reducing the p99 latency for orchestration endpoints by over 41%.\
• Engineered performant, lightweight, and modular pages using Typescript and React, leveraging dynamic imports to reduce initial load times by 14% and enhance user state rendering.

### Niricson | Software Engineer Intern | 2022

During my time at Niricson Software Inc, I was initially performing the regular full stack feature engineering. However, after time, I began taking on more responsibilities by myself and trying to tinker with the current implementations. As a result, I became well-trained in every aspect of our code-base. I was involved in everything from automation, infrastructure, geospatial data, development, etc. I loved my time there with the geospatial data development, and built several ad-hoc analysis features to deal with vectorized geospatial data.

Near the end of my time there, I leading meetings, leading dev work, conducting interviews, presenting work to our CEO, CTO, and other upper management members, etc.

Here are some of my accomplishments there:

- Automated the machine learning workflow in Python to dynamically reserve, utilize, and terminate cloud GPU instances, saving $17,000 yearly.
- Introduced a new geospatial vector data format for AWS Document DB, holding over 50% more data points, while reducing loading time by 80%.
- Optimized time-complexity of existing and new JavaScript algorithms, allowing for users to visualize and customize 500,000+ data points dynamically.
- Designed and created REST API endpoints in Java Spring Boot, following object-oriented programming and various software design patterns.

# SmartReceipt - Manage Your Spending Wisely!

Have you ever felt that sinking feeling when you glance at your credit statement and see a hefty grocery bill staring back at you? Say goodbye to that dread with SmartReceipt! ðŸ›’ðŸ’¡

### Inspiration

SmartReceipt was born out of the common frustration many of us experience when we realize how much we've spent on everyday items. In a world where cash is increasingly rare, it's easy to lose track of our spending habits. This app aims to tackle that problem head-on by promoting smart money management and raising awareness about our purchasing decisions.

### What it Does

Simply snap a picture of your receipt, and let SmartReceipt do the rest! The app interprets the prices of each item and categorizes them into more general sub-sections, giving you a clear overview of your spending habits.

### How We Built It

Our team of three tackled this project head-on, using Android Studio as our primary development platform. For text recognition, we integrated Firebase's OCR script, ensuring optimal compatibility and accuracy.

### Challenges We Faced

Navigating through the deprecation of the FirebaseVision library proved to be a major hurdle. Despite outdated information online, we persevered, piecing together solutions from various sources to make the app functional.

### Accomplishments We're Proud Of

As first-year undergraduates with limited coding experience, developing the app interface within a tight timeframe was a significant achievement. We relied heavily on free online tutorials to learn Java and Android Studio from scratch.

### What We Learned

Through this project, we gained valuable experience working with Android Studio, the Firebase Platform, and Java programming. It was a challenging but rewarding journey of self-learning and skill development.

### What's Next for Our App

In the future, we plan to expand SmartReceipt by adding additional item categories and implementing a feature to store purchase history. By allowing users to track their long-term spending and identify trends in their buying habits, we aim to empower them to make even smarter financial decisions.

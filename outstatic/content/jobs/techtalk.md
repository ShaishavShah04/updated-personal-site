# TechTalk

As the co-founder of Tech Talk Club, I spearheaded an initiative aimed at instilling tech skills among elementary and junior high school students. In this multifaceted role, I took charge of every aspect, from curriculum planning to scheduling and execution.

### **Interpersonal Dynamics**

Leading the club necessitated robust interpersonal skills. I cultivated relationships with school administrators to secure venues and fostered collaboration with fellow educators to integrate our program seamlessly into existing curricula. Additionally, I liaised with parents to garner support and ensure alignment with their expectations.

### **Community Engagement**

Beyond the logistical aspects, I prioritized community engagement. By fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment, I encouraged active participation and facilitated peer-to-peer learning among students. Furthermore, I leveraged my role to inspire enthusiasm for tech education, motivating students to explore their interests and pursue learning opportunities outside the classroom.

### **Impact and Growth**

Through Tech Talk Club, I witnessed firsthand the transformative power of technology education. By empowering young minds with essential skills, I contributed to their academic and personal growth. Moreover, the experience honed my leadership abilities, emphasizing the importance of collaboration, communication, and empathy in driving meaningful change within communities.

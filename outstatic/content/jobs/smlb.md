# Students for Machine Learning in Business

As the VP Programming at Students for Machine Learning in Business (SMLB), I handled all things tech-related. That meant making sure our events ran smoothly, from managing servers to handling submissions. I also focused on identifying areas where we could improve and brainstorming new ideas to keep things fresh. Essentially, I was the tech guru behind the scenes, ensuring everything tech-related was on point for our community of machine learning enthusiasts at SMLB.

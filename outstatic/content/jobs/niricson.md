During my time at Niricson Software Inc, I was initially performing the regular full stack feature engineering. However, after time, I began taking on more responsibilities by myself and trying to tinker with the current implementations. As a result, I became well-trained in every aspect of our code-base. I was involved in everything from automation, infrastructure, geospatial data, development, etc. I loved my time there with the geospatial data development, and built several ad-hoc analysis features to deal with vectorized geospatial data.

Near the end of my time there, I leading meetings, leading dev work, conducting interviews, presenting work to our CEO, CTO, and other upper management members, etc.

Here are some of my accomplishments there:

- Automated the machine learning workflow in Python to dynamically reserve, utilize, and terminate cloud GPU instances, saving $17,000 yearly.
- Introduced a new geospatial vector data format for AWS Document DB, holding over 50% more data points, while reducing loading time by 80%.
- Optimized time-complexity of existing and new JavaScript algorithms, allowing for users to visualize and customize 500,000+ data points dynamically.
- Designed and created REST API endpoints in Java Spring Boot, following object-oriented programming and various software design patterns.

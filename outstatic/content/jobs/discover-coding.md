# Discover Coding

In my previous position as a **Programming Instructor**, my primary responsibility revolved around delivering the Discover Coding curriculum, both in physical and virtual settings. A key aspect of my role was to comprehend intricate concepts such as *signals in C* and *asynchronous programming in JavaScript*, enabling me to effectively convey these ideas to learners. I taught ages from 6 to 14, and all sorts of concepts such as website building, advanced python, game engines, and even JS.

I excelled in meticulously planning and executing instructional sessions with unwavering consistency. Whether facilitating coding lessons or guiding students through board games to enhance problem-solving abilities, I ensured a dynamic and engaging learning environment. Additionally, **I developed the capacity to articulate technical concepts in a straightforward manner**, catering to individuals with varying levels of technical proficiency.

Beyond the classroom, I prioritized fostering positive relationships with students and parents, maintaining high standards of customer service and operational excellence. Collaborative efforts were pivotal in creating a supportive learning community. Furthermore, I actively contributed to curriculum refinement, aligning educational content with evolving needs while adhering to stringent COVID-19 health and safety protocols.

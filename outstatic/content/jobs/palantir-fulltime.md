After joining full-time, I loved that I was able to return back to my former team, but work on several different problems unlike I've ever seen before. I was a backend developer and it was super nice. 

While I've always felt that I've learnt a lot in my internships, it doesn't compare to this full time experience. Here, I got to really hone my system architecture, low-latency design, clean choices, and intuition for how things should work. *(Thank you to my team for keeping extremely high code standards! üòÅ)*

Overall, it was great though! I was happy I was able to not just learn myself, but also be able to help onboard others to the team and share what I knew.

Here's a few notable achievements from my time there (so far! I'm currently there):

- **Delivered a compliant self-service credential recovery solution** with full observability, reducing user wait times from 7 days to 2 minutes, cutting support overhead, and saving \~10,000 employee hours weekly. (I loved this project!)
- **Developed an AI-powered internal assistant** using a subagent architecture and MCP servers to unify Sourcegraph, Grafana, Jira, and other monitoring systems, automating root-cause analysis and accelerating incident resolution. (Metrics are a bit unknown as of writing this)
- **Led the engineering effort** for a low-latency security service underpinning Palantir‚Äôs core access control systems, architecting backend systems that improved response times by 95% and ensured scalability for mission-critical operations.
- **Scoped and drove large-scale projects** end-to-end, navigating complex cross-team dependencies to ensure on-time delivery and alignment with Palantir‚Äôs security and compliance requirements.
- **Onboarded engineers** in backend development best practices, accelerating time-to-independence and raising the overall technical bar of the team.

Enjoying it so far!
